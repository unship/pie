//! `AgentHarness` — opinionated assembly around the bare `Agent`. 1:1 port of
//! `packages/agent/src/harness/agent-harness.ts` (~995 lines).
//!
//! Implemented:
//! - Compose `Agent` + `Session` + skills catalog + compaction settings
//! - `prompt(text)` / `prompt_with_images` / `continue_()`
//! - Auto-compaction trigger before each LLM call (when `compaction.enabled` is true)
//! - `set_model` / `set_thinking_level` mirror state mutations onto the session log
//! - `fork()` / `move_to()` branch operations (with optional branch summary)
//! - `prompt_from_template(name, vars)` — picks a `PromptTemplate`, interpolates, prompts
//! - `replace_tools` / `replace_skills` runtime mutations
//! - `enqueue_steering` / `enqueue_follow_up` queue passthrough
//! - `subscribe` to lifecycle events
